## AsyncVersionOf type

Make all function in the type T becomes async functions and filtering non-Functions out.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export type AsyncVersionOf<T> = T extends Record<keyof T, (...args: any) => PromiseLike<any>> ? 'then' extends keyof T ? Omit<Readonly<T>, 'then'> : T : _AsyncVersionOf<T>;
```

## Remarks

Only generics signatures on function that returning an Promise<T> will be preserved due to the limitation of TypeScript.

Method called `then` are intentionally removed because it is very likely to be a foot gun in promise auto-unwrap.

## AsyncGeneratorVersionOf type

Make all generator in the type T becomes AsyncGenerator

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type AsyncGeneratorVersionOf<T> = T extends Record<keyof T, _IteratorOrIterableFunction>
    ? 'then' extends keyof T
        ? Omit<Readonly<T>, 'then'>
        : T
    : _AsyncGeneratorVersionOf<T>
```

## Remarks

Only generics signatures on function that returning an AsyncGenerator<T> will be preserved due to the limitation of TypeScript.

Method called `then` are intentionally removed because it is very likely to be a foot gun in promise auto-unwrap.

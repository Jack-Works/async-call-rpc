## AsyncGeneratorVersionOf type

Make all generator in the type T becomes AsyncGenerator

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type AsyncGeneratorVersionOf<T> = T extends Record<keyof T, _IteratorOrIterableFunction> ? 'then' extends keyof T ? Omit<Readonly<T>, 'then'> : T : _AsyncGeneratorVersionOf<T>;
```

## Remarks

Only generics signatures on function that returning an AsyncGenerator<T> will be preserved due to the limitation of TypeScript.

Method called `then` are intentionally removed because it is very likely to be a foot gun in promise auto-unwrap.

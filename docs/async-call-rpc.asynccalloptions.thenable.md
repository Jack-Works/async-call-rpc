## AsyncCallOptions.thenable property

If the instance should be "thenable".

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
thenable?: boolean;
```

## Remarks

If this options is set to `true`<!-- -->, it will return a `then` method normally (forwards the call to the remote).

If this options is set to `false`<!-- -->, it will return `undefined` even the remote has a method called "then".

If this options is set to `undefined`<!-- -->, it will return `undefined` and show a warning. You must explicitly set this option to `true` or `false` to dismiss the warning.

The motivation of this option is to resolve the problem caused by Promise auto-unwrapping.

Consider this code:

```ts
async function getRPC() {
    return AsyncCall(...)
}

```
According to the JS semantics, it will invoke the "then" method immediately on the returning instance which is unwanted in most scenarios.

To avoid this problem, methods called "then" are omitted from the type signatures. Strongly suggest to not use "then" as your RPC method name.
